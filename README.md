## What is this?

It's an example repo that show show to go from a simple hook-based application to React Query, avoiding all of the "global state" madness that normally happens!

## How do I develop on this?

- Run `yarn` and then `yarn dev` locally.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- **NOTE:** The "database" used in this app is simply a JSON file and thus will not work as a deployed application. That said, you are more than welcome to hook it up to a real API if you want!
